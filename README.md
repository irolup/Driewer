# Prerequisites
------------

This project requires:
* OpenGL 3.3 or later
* openFrameworks 0.12.0

Description of the Project
-------------------------

This project represents our first attempt at creating a graphics engine using shaders written in GLSL. It integrates the use of textures, materials, and lighting.

Sources
--------

We have used several external resources for this project:

Textures
---------

The textures used in this project come from Polyhaven's website.

Geometries
------------

We have used geometries provided by openFrameworks.

Addons
------

We have used the following addons:
* ofxAssimpModelLoader
* ofxGui
* ofxRayTracer

Inspiration
-------------

We were inspired by shaders from the following Git repositories:
* ShadersLibrary by leozimmerman
* ofxRayTracer by edap
* ofxShadersFX by Scylardor

Screenshots
------------

Here are some examples of the shaders in action:
